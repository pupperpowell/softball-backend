* Once contact has been made, the angle and velocity of the ball
* must be determined â€” as well as the location it is heading.
* 
*   Ground ball: Lower than 10 degrees
    Line drive: 10-25 degrees
    Fly ball: 25-50 degrees
    Pop up: Higher than 50 degrees
* 
* The higher a batter's contact score, 
* the more likely they are to make contact. But not only that:
* their contact score also increases chances of hitting the "sweet spot."
